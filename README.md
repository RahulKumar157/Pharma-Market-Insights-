**1. Objective:**
The main goal was to create a comprehensive dashboard that helps stakeholders quickly understand how leading pharma companies perform across critical business areas — particularly in financial growth, innovation (R&D), and intellectual property (patents).

**3. Data Preparation:**
I collected and cleaned the data using Power Query.Performed data modeling in Power BI by establishing relationships between tables such as Company, Financials, R&D, and Patents.Ensured the data model was optimized for faster performance and accurate DAX calculations.

**3. Key DAX Measures Created:**
Total Revenue = SUM of revenue column
R&D Spend % = (R&D Spend / Total Revenue) * 100
Patent Growth Rate = (Current Year Patents – Previous Year Patents) / Previous Year Patents
Rank by Revenue = RANKX function to identify top 10 companies


**4. Dashboard Design:**
Used interactive visuals like bar charts, line graphs, and KPI cards.
Included slicers and filters to analyze data by region, year, and company.
Designed a comparison view showing side-by-side performance between companies.
Added insight cards summarizing top performers and trends (e.g., which company invests the most in R&D vs which has highest patent output).

**5. Outcome:**
This dashboard helps decision-makers understand market positioning, innovation focus, and performance gaps, supporting strategic investment and R&D planning.
